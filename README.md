## 🎙️ What is VOIS.AI 🎙️

VOIS.AI is a web application that transcribes and examines a person's speech, in order to outline important information  about how a person speaks.

The goal of the app is to analyze speech to understand what words a person tends to use too often and what words that person should avoid, such as “like”, well”, “I mean”, etc.

This application is for everyone who wants to learn more about how they speak. We are specifically targeting working professionals who give regular presentations as part of their work.
